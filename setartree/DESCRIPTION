Description: The implementation of a forecasting-specific tree-based model that is in particular suitable for global time series forecasting. 
    The model uses the concept of Self Exciting Threshold Autoregressive (SETAR) models to define the node splits and thus, the model is named as SETAR-Tree. Godahewa et al. (2022) <arXiv:2211.08661v1>.
    The SETAR-Tree uses some time-series-specific splitting and stopping procedures. It trains global pooled regression models in the leaves allowing the models to learn cross-series information. The depth of the tree is controlled by conducting a statistical linearity test as well as measuring the error reduction percentage at each node split. Thus, the SETAR-Tree requires minimal external hyperparameter tuning and provides competitive results under its default configuration. 
    A forest is developed by extending the SETAR-Tree. The SETAR-Forest combines the forecasts provided by a collection of diverse SETAR-Trees during the forecasting process. 
    There are also three sample datasets provided with the package to run the models. May (1976) <doi:10.1038/261459a0>, Hewamalage et al. (2021) <doi:10.1016/j.patcog.2021.108441> and Wikimedia Analytics Team (2022) <https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/pageview_complete>.
