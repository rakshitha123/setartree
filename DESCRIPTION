Description: The implementations of the SETAR-Tree and SETAR-Forest which are forecasting-specific tree-based models that are in particular suitable for global time series forecasting. 
    The SETAR-Tree uses some time-series-specific splitting and stopping procedures. It trains global pooled regression models in the leaves allowing the models to learn cross-series information. The depth of the tree is controlled by conducting a statistical linearity test as well as measuring the error reduction percentage at each node split. Thus, the SETAR-Tree requires minimal external hyperparameter tuning and provides competitive results under its default configuration. 
    The SETAR-Forest combines the forecasts provided by a collection of diverse SETAR-Trees during the forecasting process.
